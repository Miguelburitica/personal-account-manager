# Personal Accounting Manager

This is a personal accounting manager that allows you to set goals and track your monthly (or periodic) budget, giving you insights on your financial progress. It's a simple tool I've created to help manage my personal finances and avoid using Excel for repetitive tasks.

## Main Features
In the primary user journey, as a new user, I want to:

- Set my initial balance and *optionally* group it into different accounts/banks.
- Set my monthly budget.
  - Create new expense/income items.
  - View a summary of my budget.
  - Set a goal for the budget.
- Maintain a collection of reusable expense/income items.
- Treat each budget as a log, allowing me to track my progress over time.
- Use a calculator for a year or more of financial projections.*

## Future Features
These are not critical for the main user journey but would be nice to include in future versions:

- Create an account.
- Export data to a CSV file.
- Import data from a CSV file.

## Ideas
- Categorize expenses/incomes into variable and fixed domains.
